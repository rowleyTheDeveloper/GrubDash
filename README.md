# GrubDash Front End Application

This was a Project I completed while a student of Thinful, the following description further breaks down the project:

You've been hired as a backend developer for a new startup called GrubDash! As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, you have been tasked with setting up an API and building out specific routes so that the frontend developers can demo some initial design ideas for the big bosses.

For detailed instructions on how to complete this project, consult the Instructions document in the Qualified assessment interface.

Learning objectives
This project will test your ability to build APIs with complex validation. Before taking on this project, you should be comfortable with the learning objectives listed below:

Running tests from the command line

- Using common middleware packages

- Receiving requests through routes

- Accessing relevant information through route parameters
